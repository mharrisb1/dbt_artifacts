# dbt Artifacts Package
This package builds a mart of tables and views describing the project it is installed in. In pre V1 versions of the package, the artifacts dbt produces were uploaded to the warehouse, hence the name of the package. That's no longer the case, but the name has stuck!

## Supported Data Warehouses

The package currently supports 

- Databricks :white_check_mark:
- Spark :white_check_mark:
- Snowflake adapters :white_check_mark:
- Google BigQuery :white_check_mark:

Models included:

```
dim_dbt__current_models
dim_dbt__exposures
dim_dbt__models
dim_dbt__seeds
dim_dbt__snapshots
dim_dbt__sources
dim_dbt__tests
fct_dbt__invocations
fct_dbt__model_executions
fct_dbt__seed_executions
fct_dbt__snapshot_executions
fct_dbt__test_executions
```

See the generated [dbt docs site](https://brooklyn-data.github.io/dbt_artifacts/#!/overview) for documentation on each model.

## Quickstart

1. Add this package to your `packages.yml`:
```
packages:
  - package: brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts
    version: 2.1.1
```

2. Run `dbt deps` to install the package

3. Add an on-run-end hook to your `dbt_project.yml`: `on-run-end: "{{ dbt_artifacts.upload_results(results) }}"`
(We recommend adding a conditional here so that the upload only occurs in your production environment, such as `on-run-end: "{% if target.name == 'prod' %}{{ dbt_artifacts.upload_results(results) }}{% endif %}"`)

4. If you are using [selectors](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax), be sure to include the `dbt_artifacts` models in your dbt invocation step.

5. Run your project!

> :construction_worker: Always run the dbt_artifacts models in every dbt invocation which uses the `upload_results` macro. This ensures that the source models always have the correct fields in case of an update.

## Configuration

The following configuration can be used to specify where the raw (sources) data is uploaded, and where the dbt models are created:

```yml
models:
  ...
  dbt_artifacts:
    +database: your_destination_database # optional, default is your target database
    +schema: your_destination_schema # optional, default is your target schema
    staging:
      +database: your_destination_database # optional, default is your target database
      +schema: your_destination_schema # optional, default is your target schema
    sources:
      +database: your_sources_database # optional, default is your target database
      +schema: your sources_database # optional, default is your target schema
```

Note that model materializations and `on_schema_change` configs are defined in this package's `dbt_project.yml`, so do not set them globally in your `dbt_project.yml` ([see docs on configuring packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/package-management#configuring-packages)):

> Configurations made in your dbt_project.yml file will override any configurations in a package (either in the dbt_project.yml file of the package, or in config blocks).

### Environment Variables

If the project is running in dbt Cloud, the following five columns (https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-environment-variables#special-environment-variables) will be automatically populated in the fct_dbt__invocations model:
- dbt_cloud_project_id
- dbt_cloud_job_id
- dbt_cloud_run_id
- dbt_cloud_run_reason_category
- dbt_cloud_run_reason

To capture other environment variables in the fct_dbt__invocations model in the `env_vars` column, add them to the `env_vars` variable in your `dbt_project.yml`. Note that environment variables with secrets (`DBT_ENV_SECRET_`) can't be logged.
```yml
vars:
  env_vars: [
    'ENV_VAR_1',
    'ENV_VAR_2',
    '...'
  ]
```

### dbt Variables

To capture dbt variables in the fct_dbt__invocations model in the `dbt_vars` column, add them to the `dbt_vars` variable in your `dbt_project.yml`.
```yml
vars:
  dbt_vars: [
    'var_1',
    'var_2',
    '...'
  ]
```

## Upgrading from 1.x to >=2.0.0
If you were using the following variables:

```yml
vars:
  dbt_artifacts_database: your_db
  dbt_artifacts_schema: your_schema
```

You must now move these to the following model configs:

```yml
models:
  ...
  dbt_artifacts:
    sources:
      +database: your_db
      +schema: your_schema
```

That's because the raw tables are now managed as dbt models. Be aware of any impact that [generate_database_name](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-databases#generate_database_name) and [generate_schema_name](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas#how-does-dbt-generate-a-models-schema-name) macros may have on the final database/schema.

## Migrating From <1.0.0 to >=1.0.0
To migrate your existing data from the `dbt-artifacts` versions <=0.8.0, a helper macro and guide is provided. This migration uses the old `fct_*` and `dim_*` models' data to populate the new sources. The steps to use the macro are as follows:

1. If not already completed, run `dbt run-operation create_dbt_artifacts_tables` to make your source tables.
2. Run `dbt run-operation migrate_from_v0_to_v1 --args '<see-below-for-arguments>'`.
3. Verify that the migration completes successfully.
4. Manually delete any database objects (sources, staging models, tables/views) from the previous `dbt-artifacts` version.

The arguments for `migrate_from_v0_to_v1` are as follows:
| argument     	| description                                              	|
|--------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| `old_database` 	| the database of the <1.0.0 output (`fct_`/`dim_`) models 	|
| `old_schema`   	| the schema of the <1.0.0 output (`fct_`/`dim_`) models   	|
| `new_database` 	| the target database that the artifact sources are in     	|
| `new_schema`   	| the target schema that the artifact sources are in       	|

The old and new database/schemas *do not* have to be different, but it is explicitly defined for flexible support.

An example operation is as follows:
```bash
dbt run-operation migrate_from_v0_to_v1 --args '{old_database: analytics, old_schema: dbt_artifacts, new_database: analytics, new_schema: artifact_sources}'
```

Thank you for sharing your work with the community!

### Running the tests

1. Install pipx
```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

2. Install tox
```bash
pipx install tox
```

3. Copy and paste the `integration_test_project/example-env.sh` file and save as `env.sh`. Fill in the missing values.

4. Source the file in your current shell context with the command: `. ./env.sh`.

5. From this directory, run

```
tox -e integration_snowflake # For the Snowflake tests
tox -e integration_databricks # For the Databricks tests
tox -e integration_bigquery # For the BigQuery tests
```

The Spark tests require installing the [ODBC driver](https://www.databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download). On a Mac, DBT_ENV_SPARK_DRIVER_PATH should be set to `/Library/simba/spark/lib/libsparkodbc_sbu.dylib`. Spark tests have not yet been added to the integration tests.

### SQLFluff

We use SQLFluff to keep SQL style consistent. A GitHub action automatically tests pull requests and adds annotations where there are failures. SQLFluff can also be run locally with `tox`. To install tox, we recommend using `pipx`.

Install pipx:
```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Install tox:
```bash
pipx install tox
```

Lint all models in the /models directory:
```bash
tox
```

Fix all models in the /models directory:
```bash
tox -e fix_all
```

Lint (or subsitute lint to fix) a specific model:
```bash
tox -e lint -- models/path/to/model.sql
```

Lint (or subsitute lint to fix) a specific directory:
```bash
tox -e lint -- models/path/to/directory
```

#### Rules

Enforced rules are defined within `tox.ini`. To view the full list of available rules and their configuration, see the [SQLFluff documentation](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html).
